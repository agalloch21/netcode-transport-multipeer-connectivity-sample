# Sample Project for Multipeer Connectivity Transport for Netcode for GameObjects

This project is a sample that demonstrates how to use [Multipeer Connectivity Transport for Netcode for GameObjects](https://github.com/realitydeslab/netcode-transport-multipeer-connectivity/).

Multipeer Connectivity is a powerful framework provided by Apple that enables seamless communication and data exchange between devices within the Apple ecosystem, including macOS, visionOS, iOS, and even within the Unity Editor on Mac. By using Multipeer Connectivity, developers can create applications that allow multiple Apple devices to communicate with each other in real-time, facilitating activities such as multiplayer gaming, collaborative work, and data sharing. The Multipeer Connectivity Transport for Netcode for GameObjects extends this capability to Unity-based projects, enabling developers to easily integrate cross-platform networking features into their games and applications, ensuring a consistent and robust communication experience across the entire Apple ecosystem.

## System Requirements

This sample project has been tested and verified for peer-to-peer communication using MultipeerConnectivity across the following platforms:
- iOS 17.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- macOS 14.0+
- Unity Editor 2022.3 LTS (macOS)

Note: The later versions may work but are not tested.
